Good day to who is reading this. 

Steps on running the my-app folder:

Step 2: On terminal, change your directory to my-app/Frontend "cd Frontend/

Step 3: run the folder in terminal through "npm run dev"

Step 4: You will be directed to a default page of next.js builder page. Not to worry, change the local http to "http://localhost:3000/dashboard". There you will be able to see our web design.
